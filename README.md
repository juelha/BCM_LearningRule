# BCM_LearningRule

### Task
Implement the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) learning rule featuring a sliding modification
threshold. Demonstrate through simulations how the threshold θ_M adapts based on
postsynaptic activity history, preventing runaway potentiation or depression. Show how BCM
naturally develops orientation selectivity in visual cortex models using either natural image
patches or synthetic oriented gratings as input. Compare its stability properties with standard
Hebbian learning and Oja's rule, discussing how BCM performs covariance-based rather than
correlation-based learning
